# [Computing:](https://www.youtube.com/live/9yoXMQZKPeQ?si=pQJ2cwyrcoez1esB)

Computing is a process of completing or accomplishing a task by utilizing the
computer technology. Computing may involve computer hardware and or Software,
but must involve some form of a computer system.
The task or job can be either Computational or Non-Computational.
Computational-The problems that can be solved. In order to solve a problem
computationally you need representation and Algorithm.
Non-Computational -The problem(s) that can not be solved.

# MCWG:

It is evident that in order to solve a problem computationally we need
representation, Algorithm, Hardware and Software(in other words computer).
Representation- captures all the relevant aspects of the problem.
Algorithm- An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a
problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite
amount of time. The word “algorithm” is derived from the ninth-century Arab
mathematician, Al-Khwarizmi.

Let us solve an example in order to understand the concept of representation and
algorithm.
Example:
The Man ,wolf, goat and cabbage problem is a river crossing problem.

A man lives on the east side of a river. He wishes to bring a cabbage, a goat, and a
wolf to a village on the west side of the river to sell.

However his boat is big enough to hold himself and either the cabbage, goat, or wolf.
In addition, the man cannot leave the goat alone with the cabbage because the goat
will eat the cabbage, and he cannot leave the wolf alone with the goat because the
wolf will eat the goat. How does the man solve his problem?
Solution:
There is a simple algorithmic approach for solving this problem by simply trying all
possible combinations of items that may be rowed back and forth across the river.
Trying all possible solutions is referred to as a brute force approach.
Solution 1:
Algorithm:
Step 1:Start
Step 2:man rows goat.
Step 3: man rows back alone.
Step 4:man rows cabbage across.
Step 5: man takes goat back.
Step 6: man leaves goat and rows wolf across.
Step 7: man rows back alone.
Step 8: man rows goat across.
Step 9: Stop

Solution 2:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: man rows goat.
Step 3: man rows back alone.
Step 4: man rows wolf across.
Step 5: man takes goat back.
Step 6: man leaves goat and rows cabbage across.
Step 7: man rows back alone.
Step 8: man rows goat across.
Step 9: Stop
In the above example we are not worried about
 Color of the boat?
 Name of the man?
 Width of the river?
Thus ,the only information relevant for this problem is where each particular item is
at each step in the problem solving. Therefore, by the use of abstraction, we define
a representation that captures only this needed information.
